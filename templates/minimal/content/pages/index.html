      This is the Minimal template for Forge—a modern static site generator
      built in C++. It focuses on simplicity, readability, and clean design.

    <h2>Fast & Efficient</h2>
    <p>
      Forge generates static HTML with instant builds and hot-reload during
      development. Your content updates automatically as you edit, making the
      development experience seamless.

    <h2>Template Structure</h2>
    <p>
      This template uses Forge's custom template engine with Jinja2-like syntax.
      Create pages with Markdown or HTML, organize content in collections, and
      use variables like <code>{{ "{{ title }}" }}</code> and
      <code>{{ "{{ content }}" }}</code> throughout your templates.
