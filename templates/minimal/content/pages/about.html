    <h2>About This Template</h2>
    <p>
      Minimal is a carefully crafted template for Forge, designed with a focus
      on typography, whitespace, and content clarity. It provides a solid
      foundation for building clean, fast static websites.

    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Every design decision in this template follows the principle of
      essentialism—keeping only what serves the content and the reader. No
      unnecessary elements, no visual clutter, just pure focus on what matters
      most.
    </p>
    <p>
      The typography uses system fonts for instant loading and native feel. The
      layout breathes with generous spacing, making content easy to read and
      navigate.

    <h2>Built for Forge</h2>
    <p>
      This template takes full advantage of Forge's features: fast C++ builds,
      hot-reload development, and flexible template syntax. Whether you're
      building a personal site, portfolio, or documentation, Minimal provides a
      clean starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can easily extend this template with Forge's template engine—add loops
      for blog posts, conditionals for dynamic content, and filters for text
      formatting.

    <h2>Customization</h2>
    <p>
      The template is intentionally simple to make customization
      straightforward. All styles are contained in a single CSS block, making it
      easy to adjust colors, spacing, and typography to match your preferences.
